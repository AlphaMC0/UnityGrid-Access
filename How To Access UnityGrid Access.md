# How to Access UnityGrid Access

- First Launch **IDLE**. If you don't have it already download [**Python for MAC**](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [**Python for WINDOWS**](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3123/)

- Next make a new file in **IDLE**
- Now Copy the [**SOURCE CODE**](https://github.com/AlphaMC0/UnityGrid-Access/blob/main/Source%20Code.md) and paste it into the file you just created.
